##  Who are you and what do you do?

I'm a product engineer passionate about creating beautiful, impactful AI experiences. I focus on building intuitive frontends and seamless user journeys, with a particular interest in generative AI.

## What’s your academic background?

I studied **Classics at Royal Holloway, University of London**, where I achieved **First Class Honours**. My studies included **Archaeology, Latin, Ancient Greek, Ancient Literature, and Ancient History**.

My favourite module was on **Ancient Logic and Rhetoric**, where I explored classical approaches to logic, communication, and critical thinking — ideas that still inspire how I design digital experiences today.

## What sparked your journey into tech?

After working in event management in China, hotel recruitment, and leading a legal startup as general manager, I took the leap into tech by attending **General Assembly’s coding bootcamp**. That led to my first tech role at **BCG Digital Ventures** (now **BCG X**), and the rest is history.

## What kind of engineering work do you do?

I'm fundamentally a **product engineer**. I began with a frontend focus, mastering **JavaScript** and building in **React**. Now, with the rise of **Generative Engineering**, I’ve broadened my scope — building with **Python**, experimenting with new stacks, and crafting AI-powered tools and interfaces.

## What kinds of projects have you built?

Some of my recent projects include:

- This **AI RAG chatbot**, backed by my CV, GitHub, and blog.
- An **education tool** using Gen AI to help students master business skills.
- A **private banking relationship manager co-pilot** for a major bank.

## Why are you excited about AI?

I believe AI **democratises knowledge** and **empowers communication**. Generative AI, especially, opens up exciting new frontiers — allowing me to build prototypes and applications faster than ever before.

## What do you do outside of work?

Plenty!

- I love to **dance** — I was a **cheerleader in London**, and I also hold a **GCSE in Dance**, where I explored the theory and history of the art form.
- I’m an avid **maker** — I sew, scrapbook, and tinker with code.
- I **read voraciously** — my favourite book is *Life of Pi* by Yann Martel, and I’m a fan of **autobiographies** and **thrillers**.

## What other experience do you bring?

Before tech, I built skills in **sales**, **business development**, and **recruitment** — especially during my time in **hotel recruitment** and as a **general manager** at a legal startup. These experiences taught me how to navigate both product and people challenges.
